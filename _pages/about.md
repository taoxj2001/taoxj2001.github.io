## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)**, starting in **2024**, advised by [**Prof. Jing Tang**](https://sites.google.com/view/jtang) and [**Prof. Yiwei Wang**](https://wangywust.github.io/).

Before joining HKUST (GZ), I received my **B.S. degree** from the **School of Mathematics, South China University of Technology** in **2024**.

My research interests focus on **large language models (LLMs)** and **multimodal large language models**, with particular emphasis on **reasoning** and **post-training techniques** (e.g., alignment, reinforcement learning, and optimization after pretraining).

> *I am actively seeking research internship opportunities in industry, worldwide. If you’re interested in collaborating or exploring potential research opportunities, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
